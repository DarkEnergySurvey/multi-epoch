In the root directory of the shapelets distribution:

    ./configure
    make
    make install

The main executable "measure_stars" and the python script measure_stars.py will
be copied into the ../bin directory, which in the des framework is
pipeline/development/bin.  See the documentation for these functions for usage
info.

The C++ code and python scripts have essentially the same inputs.  The C++ code
is written as a standard unix utility, so the exit code is used to describe the
result of the processing.  Because any exit code other than 0 crashes the
scripts used later (why on earth?) the python script was written as a wrapper
to catch the exit code and write it to an "exitlog" file.  Also from python
gnuplot is called to make a size-magnitude diagram.

Please report the exit code when available for debugging purposes.
