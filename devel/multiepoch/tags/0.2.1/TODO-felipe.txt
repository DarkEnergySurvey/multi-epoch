Things I'd like to add:

- move all queries to querylibs.py
- merge query_tileinfo.py and find_ccds_in_tile.py into a single task
- After the mer add ctx.BANDs and dBANDs, etc to the tileinfo.json file
- Now BANDS is read from the json file and not set-up using the
  utils.contextDefs.setBANDs() function
